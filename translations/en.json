    "description": "<p>Palinodes is an evolving experiment in writing as play. It's a space where short texts can be shaped and reshaped by different hands, until the process becomes etched into the text, and it finds its own voice. It's a space for offering a small text — not to the hive mind, nor the artificial one, but to a few singular, imperfect minds, for revision, erasure, and surprise. There's no wrong path. Palinodes tries to clear the way for many — and for the journeys they might incite.</p>",

She builds tools and experiences that bring people together — not just to write, but to play, surprise one another, and rediscover the strange alchemy of shared imagination."
